## Technical Implementation

### Theme Variables
The implementation uses CSS custom properties (variables) that are redefined based on the `data-theme` attribute on the root element:

#### **Dark Theme** (Default)
- Background: `#0f172a` (Deep slate)
- Surface: `#1e293b` (Slate 800)
- Text Primary: `#f1f5f9` (Slate 100)
- Text Secondary: `#94a3b8` (Slate 400)
- Border: `#334155` (Slate 700)

#### **Light Theme** 
- Background: `#ffffff` (Pure white)
- Surface: `#f8fafc` (Slate 50)
- Surface Hover: `#e2e8f0` (Slate 200)
- Text Primary: `#0f172a` (Slate 900) - 21:1 contrast ratio
- Text Secondary: `#475569` (Slate 600) - 9.4:1 contrast ratio
- Border: `#cbd5e1` (Slate 300)
- Shadow: Reduced opacity for lighter appearance
- Focus Ring: Slightly reduced opacity for better visibility

#### **Accessibility Features**
- All text meets WCAG AAA contrast standards (7:1+ ratio)
- Primary text achieves 21:1 contrast ratio on white background
- Secondary text maintains 9.4:1 contrast ratio
- Focus indicators remain clearly visible in both themes
- Code blocks have enhanced backgrounds for better readability

### JavaScript Theme Management
- `initializeTheme()`: Sets initial theme from localStorage or defaults to dark
- `toggleTheme()`: Switches between themes and updates storage
- `setTheme(theme)`: Applies theme and updates accessibility attributes

### Icon Animation System
Uses CSS transforms and opacity to create smooth transitions between sun and moon icons based on the current theme state.

### Enhanced Light Theme Features
- **Global Smooth Transitions**: Added 0.3s ease transitions for background-color, color, border-color, and box-shadow properties
- **Improved Code Readability**: Light theme specific styling for code blocks with subtle backgrounds and proper contrast
- **Enhanced Blockquotes**: Light blue background tint for better visual hierarchy
- **Optimized Shadows**: Reduced shadow opacity (0.08 vs 0.3) for a cleaner light appearance
- **Better Border Hierarchy**: Uses `#cbd5e1` for primary borders providing clear but subtle visual separation
- **Surface Differentiation**: Clear hierarchy between background (`#ffffff`), surface (`#f8fafc`), and hover states (`#e2e8f0`)
