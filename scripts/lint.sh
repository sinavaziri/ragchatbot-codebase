# Code Quality Lint Script - READ-ONLY CHECKS
# This script verifies code quality without making any changes to files.
# Perfect for CI/CD pipelines, pre-commit hooks, and code review.
#
# What it does:
# 1. Runs flake8 linting (style violations, complexity)
# 2. Runs mypy type checking (type safety)
# 3. Checks import sorting without fixing (shows diff)
# 4. Checks code formatting without fixing (shows diff)
#
# Usage: ./scripts/lint.sh
# Prerequisites: uv sync --group dev
# Exit codes: 0 = all checks pass, non-zero = issues found
